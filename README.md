# Deep Learning Project
## Introduction
Detecting the actual perception of the emotion expressed by human face is important and it can effectively improve the diagnostic of mental health. The diameter change pattern of pupillary response can be used to classify whether a person is watching a real or posed anger. In this project, Shallow neural network with Casper algorithm and Deep Learning including CNN and LSTM are used to construct the classification model.
