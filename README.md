# Deep Learning Project
## Introduction
Detecting the actual perception of the emotion expressed by human face is important and it can effectively improve the diagnostic of mental health. The diameter change pattern of pupillary response can be used to classify whether a person is watching a real or posed anger. In this project, Shallow neural network with Casper algorithm and Deep Learning including CNN and LSTM are used to construct the classification model.

## Main parts of project
1. Introduction

2. Datasets Description and Pre-Processing

3. Shallow Neural Network with Casper algorithm, RPROP and SARPROP algorithm

4. Deep Learning with padding, Convolutional neural network, LSTM

5. Model Design

6. Result and Discussion

7. Conclusion and Future Work

## Main tasks and results
•	Implement shallow neural network with Casper algorithm from scratch using Pytorch/Python

•	Fine tuning hyperparameters and improve model performance from 60% to 94% accuracy

•	Extend the shallow neural network into deep learning including CNN and LSTM

•	Do research and find method to improve LSTM performance from 50% to 60% accuracy
